## Welcome to the Spring AI Community

The main goal of the Spring AI Community GitHub organization is to create an easy path for people to contribute Spring AI related projects. The need for a GitHub organization stems from the Spring AI project receiving many pull requests for additional features and functionality that the core team can't easily maintain or nurture.

By creating this GitHub organization, we hope that an ecosystem of community-driven projects can develop to fill this gap. Having a known 'hub' for Spring AI related projects will help foster discovery and encourage more features and projects to be developed.

This community describes the process to create a project, how projects are managed, and how the Spring AI project will incorporate these community projects in a manner similar to other community projects in the Spring ecosystem, such as those for the Spring Cloud and Spring Data projects.
