## Governance Model

The Spring AI Community governance model is designed to be lightweight and developer-friendly, emphasizing autonomy for project owners while providing just enough structure to ensure coherence within the ecosystem. This model prioritizes flexibility, rapid decision-making, and minimizes bureaucracy.

Our goal is to enable project owners to have the most say in how their projects develop while ensuring basic compatibility with Spring AI's core values and technical approach.

The Spring AI Community Leads consist of **Thomas Vitale, Sergi Almar, and Adib Saikali**. These leads help oversee the community organization and provide guidance when needed.

<Note>
While there is no fixed term for these positions, the group should ideally maintain an odd number of members to prevent tied votes in decision-making processes.
</Note>

## IP Ownership

Project contributors **retain ownership of their intellectual property**. All contributions must be made under the Apache 2.0 license to ensure compatibility with the Spring ecosystem, but Broadcom (the owner of Spring) takes no control of the IP for projects within this process.

## Lightweight Governance Structure

The Spring AI Community follows a technical leadership model focused on rapid decision-making and technical excellence:

- **Project Technical Leads** have full authority over technical decisions within their project (in compliance with code of conduct and security guidelines)

## Project Acceptance

<Steps>
  <Step title="Unanimous Approval Required">
    Project acceptance into the spring-ai-community requires **unanimous approval from all Spring AI Community Leads**
  </Step>
  <Step title="GitHub Issue Discussion">
    Discussions and voting for project acceptance take place within the GitHub issue that's automatically created when a new project submission form is filled out
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feedback & Reconsideration">
    If unanimous approval cannot be reached, the project may be reconsidered after addressing feedback
  </Step>
  <Step title="Timely Decisions">
    Decisions are made within 2 weeks of submission when possible
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project Guidance

- Projects are intended to be as **autonomous as possible** with Technical Leads driving their direction
- Technical disagreements within projects should first be addressed by Project Technical Leads
- If assistance is needed, Project Leads can mention Spring AI Community Leads in a GitHub issue on their project repository
- The Spring AI Community Leads serve as a resource for mediation if requested and as the final escalation path for significant technical disagreements
- Decisions made during conflict resolution require majority agreement among Community Leads

## Project Communication

Each project uses the following communication channels:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="GitHub Discussions">
    For technical decisions and community interaction within their own repository
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="GitHub Issues">
    For bug reports and feature requests within the project repository
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Slack Workspace">
    For project leads to discuss administrative matters
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
