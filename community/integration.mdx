## Official Spring AI Community Projects

Much like with Spring Cloud and Spring Data, there is a known set of stable community projects that are promoted alongside the main project. These appear on the project page on spring.io and are also incorporated into the reference documentation.

<Info>
The Spring AI team will decide which community projects will be officially recognized. The goal is to establish a quality bar so that users don't encounter outdated projects.
</Info>

## Bill of Materials (BOM) Policy

Based on feedback from previous community project experiences, **community projects will not be listed in the Spring AI BOM** (bill of materials).

<Note>
This decision ensures that the Spring AI core team maintains control over compatibility guarantees while still supporting the community ecosystem.
</Note>

## Requirements for Official Listing

Projects seeking to be listed as official Spring AI Community projects on the Spring AI website and documentation must demonstrate ongoing health and activity.

### Evaluation Criteria

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Periodic Review">
    - Review by the Spring AI team (typically quarterly)
    - Public GitHub activity metrics (commits, issue responses, PR reviews)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quality Standards">
    **Build & Testing**
    - Passing CI pipeline with unit and/or integration tests

    **Documentation**
    - Up-to-date project documentation that follows Spring AI's format and standards

    **Compatibility**
    - Compatibility with the latest Spring AI release
    - Alignment with Spring AI's architecture, coding standards, and integration patterns
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code Quality">
    Code quality and structure must meet Spring team standards for potential inclusion in the core project, including:
    - Proper use of Spring abstractions
    - Consistent error handling
    - Alignment with Spring's programming model
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### No Formal Reporting Required

<Check>
No formal reporting is required from project maintainers beyond what is publicly visible in repositories. The Spring AI team will use these public indicators to determine which community projects to promote.
</Check>

## Project Lifecycle Management

### Active Projects

Projects that remain active and meet quality standards will continue to be promoted on:
- Spring AI project page on spring.io
- Spring AI reference documentation
- Spring AI community listings

### Inactive Projects

<Warning>
Projects that remain inactive for extended periods (6+ months) or fall below quality standards may be:
- Removed from official listings
- Remain in the spring-ai-community organization
- Potentially become candidates for archival
</Warning>

This ensures that users always find maintained, high-quality projects when browsing official Spring AI Community recommendations.
