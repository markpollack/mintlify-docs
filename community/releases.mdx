## Release Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Semantic Versioning">
    All projects must follow a clear [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (semver) scheme:

    - **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
    - **MINOR**: New features (backwards compatible)
    - **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backwards compatible)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Passing CI/CD Pipeline">
    All tests and quality checks must pass before release
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Documentation Updates">
    Documentation must reflect any new features, changes, or deprecations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clear Changelog">
    A well-structured changelog describing what has changed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Maven Central Publication

### Preferred Path

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use GitHub Actions">
    The preferred release path is via GitHub Actions in the community repository
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maven Central Publishing">
    Publish to Maven Central using GitHub-based publishing conventions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Standard GroupId">
    Artifacts should use the groupId `io.github.springaicommunity`
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Artifact Naming

- Artifact IDs (e.g., `spring-ai-rag-helper`) may include dashes and should follow standard naming patterns
- Root Java package names are flexible and up to the contributor, though they should follow common Spring conventions

<Note>
This naming suggestion is specific to the GitHub-based Maven Central process. Project owners can use their own bespoke process and their own artifact IDs to publish to a public Maven repository.
</Note>

<Warning>
The release templates for community-hosted repositories **cannot use Spring's internal Maven Central credentials** â€” credential sharing is not permitted.
</Warning>
