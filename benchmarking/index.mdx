description: "Open benchmarking for enterprise Java AI agents"

## Overview

Spring AI Bench is an open-source benchmarking framework focused on evaluating AI agents in enterprise Java development contexts. The project aims to provide transparent, reproducible benchmarks that address the limitations of existing approaches.

## Why This Matters

### The Problem with Current Benchmarks

Existing benchmarks like SWE-bench were groundbreaking for their time, but they have limitations:

<Warning>
**Key Limitations:**
- **Python-centric**: 7-10% performance gap for non-Python languages
- **Static datasets**: 2023 patches don't reflect current development patterns
- **Narrow scope**: Only patch-loop agents, missing modern declarative approaches
- **Single architecture**: Can't evaluate Claude, Gemini, Amazon Q, or other production agents
- **Contamination**: Studies show 60%+ verified â†’ 19% live performance drops
</Warning>

### Our Approach

<Steps>
  <Step title="Full Development Lifecycle">
    Measure agents on real enterprise tasks: issue triage, PR review, test coverage, compliance, API migration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Language Diversity">
    Java-first focus to address training bias, but extensible to other JVM and non-JVM languages
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Flexibility">
    Support any agent via `AgentModel` abstractionâ€”evaluate the tools YOUR team actually uses
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transparency & Reproducibility">
    One-click Docker execution, open scaffolding, clear documentation of methodology
  </Step>
</Steps>
