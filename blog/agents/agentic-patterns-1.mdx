In a recent research publication: [Building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents), Anthropic shared valuable insights about building effective Large Language Model (LLM) agents. What makes this research particularly interesting is its emphasis on simplicity and composability over complex frameworks. Let's explore how these principles translate into practical implementations using [Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/index.html).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-io/spring-io-static/refs/heads/main/blog/tzolov/spring-ai-agentic-systems.jpg" alt="Agent Systems" width="350"/>

While the pattern descriptions and diagrams are sourced from Anthropic's original publication, we'll focus on how to implement these patterns using Spring AI's features for model portability and structured output. We recommend reading the original paper first.

The [agentic-patterns](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns) project implements the patterns discussed below.

## Agentic Systems

The research publication makes an important architectural distinction between two types of agentic systems:

1. **Workflows**: Systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths (e.g., prescriptive system)
2. **Agents**: Systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage

The key insight is that while fully autonomous agents might seem appealing, workflows often provide better predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks. This aligns perfectly with enterprise requirements where reliability and maintainability are crucial.

Let's examine how Spring AI implements these concepts through five fundamental patterns, each serving specific use cases:

### 1. [Chain Workflow](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns/chain-workflow)

The Chain Workflow pattern exemplifies the principle of breaking down complex tasks into simpler, more manageable steps.

![Prompt Chaining Workflow](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F7418719e3dab222dccb379b8879e1dc08ad34c78-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75)

**When to Use:**
- Tasks with clear sequential steps
- When you want to trade latency for higher accuracy
- When each step builds on the previous step's output

Here's a practical example from Spring AI's implementation:

```java
public class ChainWorkflow {
    private final ChatClient chatClient;
    private final String[] systemPrompts;

    // Processes input through a series of prompts, where each step's output
    // becomes input for the next step in the chain.     
    public String chain(String userInput) {
        String response = userInput;
        for (String prompt : systemPrompts) {
            // Combine the system prompt with previous response
            String input = String.format("{%s}\n {%s}", prompt, response);
            // Process through the LLM and capture output
            response = chatClient.prompt(input).call().content();
        }
        return response;
    }
}
```

This implementation demonstrates several key principles:
- Each step has a focused responsibility
- Output from one step becomes input for the next
- The chain is easily extensible and maintainable

### 2. [Parallelization Workflow](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns/parallelization-workflow)

LLMs can work simultaneously on tasks and have their outputs aggregated programmatically. The parallelization workflow manifests in two key variations:

- **Sectioning**: Breaking tasks into independent subtasks for parallel processing
- **Voting**: Running multiple instances of the same task for consensus

![Parallelization Workflow](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F406bb032ca007fd1624f261af717d70e6ca86286-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75)

**When to Use:**
- Processing large volumes of similar but independent items
- Tasks requiring multiple independent perspectives
- When processing time is critical and tasks are parallelizable

The Parallelization Workflow pattern demonstrates efficient concurrent processing of multiple Large Language Model (LLM) operations. This pattern is particularly useful for scenarios requiring parallel execution of LLM calls with automated output aggregation.

Here's a basic example of using the Parallelization Workflow:

```java
List<String> parallelResponse = new ParallelizationWorkflow(chatClient)
    .parallel(
        "Analyze how market changes will impact this stakeholder group.",
        List.of(
            "Customers: ...",
            "Employees: ...",
            "Investors: ...",
            "Suppliers: ..."
        ),
        4
    );
```

This example demonstrates parallel processing of stakeholder analysis, where each stakeholder group is analyzed concurrently.

### 3. [Routing Workflow](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns/routing-workflow)

The Routing pattern implements intelligent task distribution, enabling specialized handling for different types of input.

![Routing Workflow](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F5c0c0e9fe4def0b584c04d37849941da55e5e71c-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75)

This pattern is designed for complex tasks where different types of inputs are better handled by specialized processes. It uses an LLM to analyze input content and route it to the most appropriate specialized prompt or handler.

**When to Use:**
- Complex tasks with distinct categories of input
- When different inputs require specialized processing
- When classification can be handled accurately

Here's a basic example of using the Routing Workflow:

```java
@Autowired
private ChatClient chatClient;

// Create the workflow
RoutingWorkflow workflow = new RoutingWorkflow(chatClient);

// Define specialized prompts for different types of input
Map<String, String> routes = Map.of(
    "billing", "You are a billing specialist. Help resolve billing issues...",
    "technical", "You are a technical support engineer. Help solve technical problems...",
    "general", "You are a customer service representative. Help with general inquiries..."
);

// Process input
String input = "My account was charged twice last week";
String response = workflow.route(input, routes);
```

### 4. [Orchestrator-Workers](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns/orchestrator-workers)

This pattern demonstrates how to implement more complex agent-like behavior while maintaining control:
- A central LLM orchestrates task decomposition
- Specialized workers handle specific subtasks
- Clear boundaries maintain system reliability

![Orchestration Workflow](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8985fc683fae4780fb34eab1365ab78c7e51bc8e-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75)

**When to Use:**
- Complex tasks where subtasks can't be predicted upfront
- Tasks requiring different approaches or perspectives
- Situations needing adaptive problem-solving

The implementation uses Spring AI's ChatClient for LLM interactions and consists of:

```java
public class OrchestratorWorkersWorkflow {
    public WorkerResponse process(String taskDescription) {
        // 1. Orchestrator analyzes task and determines subtasks
        OrchestratorResponse orchestratorResponse = // ...

        // 2. Workers process subtasks in parallel
        List<String> workerResponses = // ...

        // 3. Results are combined into final response
        return new WorkerResponse(/*...*/);
    }
}
```

#### Usage Example:

```java
ChatClient chatClient = // ... initialize chat client
OrchestratorWorkersWorkflow workflow = new OrchestratorWorkersWorkflow(chatClient);

// Process a task
WorkerResponse response = workflow.process(
    "Generate both technical and user-friendly documentation for a REST API endpoint"
);

// Access results
System.out.println("Analysis: " + response.analysis());
System.out.println("Worker Outputs: " + response.workerResponses());
```

### 5. [Evaluator-Optimizer](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns/evaluator-optimizer)

The Evaluator-Optimizer pattern implements a dual-LLM process where one model generates responses while another provides evaluation and feedback in an iterative loop, similar to a human writer's refinement process. The pattern consists of two main components:

- **Generator LLM**: Produces initial responses and refines them based on feedback
- **Evaluator LLM**: Analyzes responses and provides detailed feedback for improvement

![Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F14f51e6406ccb29e695da48b17017e899a6119c7-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75)

**When to Use:**
- Clear evaluation criteria exist
- Iterative refinement provides measurable value
- Tasks benefit from multiple rounds of critique

The implementation uses Spring AI's ChatClient for LLM interactions and consists of:

```java
public class EvaluatorOptimizerWorkflow {
    public RefinedResponse loop(String task) {
        // 1. Generate initial solution
        Generation generation = generate(task, context);
        
        // 2. Evaluate the solution
        EvaluationResponse evaluation = evaluate(generation.response(), task);
        
        // 3. If PASS, return solution
        // 4. If NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT, incorporate feedback and generate new solution
        // 5. Repeat until satisfactory
        return new RefinedResponse(finalSolution, chainOfThought);
    }
}
```

#### Usage Example:

```java
ChatClient chatClient = // ... initialize chat client
EvaluatorOptimizerWorkflow workflow = new EvaluatorOptimizerWorkflow(chatClient);

// Process a task
RefinedResponse response = workflow.loop(
    "Create a Java class implementing a thread-safe counter"
);

// Access results
System.out.println("Final Solution: " + response.solution());
System.out.println("Evolution: " + response.chainOfThought());
```
