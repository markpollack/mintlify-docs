The [Spring AI Community GitHub organization](https://github.com/spring-ai-community) was announced at the [Spring I/O Barcelona 2025 keynote](https://youtu.be/oUK1Np4OvnM?si=st_k2WJa8dSQmQAY&t=3299) as a dedicated space for community-driven Spring AI projects and innovations.  However, I never blogged about it to get more awareness so now is the time.  Better late than never and now with a new web site!


**Check out the Spring AI Community at [springaicommunity.mintlify.app](https://springaicommunity.mintlify.app)**

The Spring AI Community creates an easy path for developers to contribute Spring AI-related projects while providing a vital incubation space for new ideas. As the Spring AI project has grown, it has received numerous pull requests for additional features and integrations that, while valuable, the core team cannot easily maintain or nurture within the main repository. This independent community organization solves that challenge by establishing a known hub where community projects can thrive and be discovered.

## Community Leadership

The Spring AI Community is guided by three prominent leaders who bring deep expertise in Spring technologies and community building:

**[Sergi Almar](https://github.com/salmar)** - Spring community advocate and technology leader
**[Adib Saikali](https://github.com/asaikali)** - Enterprise architecture expert and Spring educator
**[Thomas Vitale](https://github.com/ThomasVitale)** - Cloud native Java specialist and author

Together, they oversee a lightweight governance model that emphasizes project autonomy and rapid decision-making while maintaining alignment with Spring AI's core values.

## Current Projects

The community has already has a nice collection of projects across two categories:

### Production Projects

**[Moonshot](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/moonshot)** - Comprehensive Java client for Moonshot AI API with support for Chinese language models (moonshot-v1-8k/32k/128k), streaming responses, and function calling. Led by [Geng](https://github.com/mxsl-gr).

**[QianFan](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/qianfan)** - Integration with Baidu's QianFan AI platform offering chat models, embedding models, and image generation capabilities. Led by [Geng](https://github.com/mxsl-gr).

### Incubating Projects

**[Spring AI Agents](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-agents)** - Autonomous CLI agent integrations bringing Claude Code, Gemini, Amazon Q, Amp, and Codex to Spring applications with unified AgentClient API and Spring Boot auto-configuration. Led by [Mark Pollack](https://github.com/markpollack).

**[Spring AI Bench](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-bench)** - Open benchmarking suite for Java-centric AI developer agents, measuring real enterprise development tasks like issue triage, PR review, and test coverage uplift. The project achieved 71.4% test coverage autonomously on Spring's gs-rest-service tutorial. Led by [Mark Pollack](https://github.com/markpollack).

**[MCP Annotations](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/mcp-annotations)** - Annotation-based method handling for Model Context Protocol servers in Java, simplifying MCP server creation with declarative annotations for tools, resources, and prompts. Led by [Christian Tzolov](https://github.com/tzolov).

**[MCP Security](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/mcp-security)** - Security support for Model Context Protocol implementations providing authentication, authorization, and secure deployment patterns. Led by [Daniel Garnier-Moiroux](https://github.com/Kehrlann).

**[Spring AI Vaadin](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-vaadin)** - Rich Vaadin UI components for building AI-powered chat applications with RAG support and MCP integration. Led by [Tomi Virkki](https://github.com/tomivirkki).

**[Spring AI Playground](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-playground)** - Self-hosted web UI for AI experimentation and testing, enabling developers to explore Spring AI capabilities interactively. Led by [Jemin Huh](https://github.com/JM-Lab).

**[Spring AG-UI](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-agui)** - AG-UI protocol implementation for Spring AI, enabling advanced agent-to-UI communication patterns. Led by [Pascal Wilbrink](https://github.com/pascalwilbrink).

## Lightweight Governance

The Spring AI Community follows a developer-friendly governance model that prioritizes:

- **Project Autonomy** - Technical leads have full authority over their projects
- **Rapid Decision-Making** - Unanimous approval from community leads for new projects
- **IP Ownership** - Contributors retain ownership of their intellectual property under Apache 2.0 license
- **Open Communication** - GitHub Discussions for technical decisions, Issues for feature requests

Projects are as autonomous as possible, with community leads serving as a resource for mediation and guidance when needed.

## Get Involved

We welcome new projects and contributors to the Spring AI Community:

**Propose a Project** - Have an idea for a Spring AI integration or tool? Submit a [project proposal](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/community/issues/new?template=application.yml) to get started.

**Explore Projects** - Browse our growing catalog at [springaicommunity.mintlify.app](https://springaicommunity.mintlify.app) to discover integrations, tools, and examples.

**Contribute** - Check out existing projects and contribute code, documentation, or feedback. Each project maintains its own contribution guidelines.
