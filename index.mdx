## Our Mission

The main goal of the Spring AI Community GitHub organization is to create an easy path for people to contribute Spring AI related projects. The need for this organization stems from the Spring AI project receiving many pull requests for additional features and functionality that the core team can't easily maintain or nurture.

By creating this GitHub organization, we hope that an ecosystem of community-driven projects can develop to fill this gap. Having a known 'hub' for Spring AI related projects will help foster discovery and encourage more features and projects to be developed.
