## Overview

Spring AI Playground is a self-hosted web UI that simplifies AI experimentation and testing. It provides Java developers with an intuitive interface for working with large language models (LLMs), vector databases, prompt engineering, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations.

Built on Spring AI, it supports leading model providers and includes comprehensive tools for testing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows and MCP integrations. The goal is to make AI more accessible to developers, helping them quickly prototype Spring AI-based applications with enhanced contextual awareness and external tool capabilities.

## Playgrounds

### Chat Playground

A unified chat interface powered by Spring AI's ChatClient that can dynamically use configurations from VectorDB and MCP playgrounds, enabling conversations enriched with retrieval and external tools.

### VectorDB Playground

Supports full RAG flows:
- Upload and manage documents
- Chunk and embed content
- Search vector databases
- Inspect retrieval results with score details

Implemented using Spring AI's `RetrievalAugmentationAdvisor`.

### MCP Playground

Integrates Spring AI's Model Context Protocol, allowing developers to:
- Register external tools
- Test tool invocations interactively
- Monitor tool execution
