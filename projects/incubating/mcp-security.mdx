## Overview

The MCP Security project provides security support and best practices for implementing secure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients in Java.

<Note>
This is an incubating project focused on bringing enterprise-grade security to MCP implementations.

## Why MCP Security Matters

The Model Context Protocol enables powerful integrations between AI systems and external tools/resources. However, this power requires careful security considerations:

<Warning>
**Security Risks:**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive resources
- Data exfiltration through MCP tools
- Code injection via malicious prompts
- Resource exhaustion attacks
- Privilege escalation
</Warning>

MCP Security aims to provide a comprehensive security framework to mitigate these risks.

## Use Cases

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enterprise MCP Servers">
    Secure MCP servers for enterprise environments with strict security requirements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multi-tenant Systems">
    Isolate MCP resources and operations across different tenants
  </Step>
  <Step title="Public MCP Services">
    Protect public-facing MCP endpoints from abuse and attacks
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regulated Industries">
    Meet compliance requirements for healthcare, finance, and government sectors
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting Started

<Info>
This project is currently in the incubation phase. Documentation and examples will be added as features are implemented.
