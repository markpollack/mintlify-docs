## Overview

Spring AI AG-UI provides an implementation of the AG-UI protocol for Spring AI applications. AG-UI is a protocol designed to enable seamless integration between AI agents and user interfaces, allowing for rich, interactive AI-powered applications.

<Note>
This project was recently approved and is in the process of being migrated to the spring-ai-community organization.

## What is AG-UI?

AG-UI (Agent-UI) is a protocol that bridges the gap between AI agents and user interfaces, providing a standardized way for agents to interact with UI components, handle user interactions, and manage application state.
